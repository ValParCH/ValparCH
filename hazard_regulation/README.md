## Hazard regulation NCP

Regulation of natural hazard by the landscape is mapped based on protective forests (data from SilvaProtectCH, Losey & Wehrli, 2013) and [floodplains](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/fr/home/themes/biodiversite/info-specialistes/mesures-de-conservation-de-la-biodiversite/infrastructure-ecologique/biotopes-d_importance-nationale/zones-alluviales.html).

### Workflow

#### Supply

The cartography of this ES is based on the ability of forests to protect human infrastructures from natural hazards, namely landslides, avalanches, flood, and rockfalls. For the supply of this ES, we considered forests that are overlapping with natural hazard risks. We accessed modeled data on natural hazards from the FOEN (Losey & Wehrli, 2013).

#### Flow

For the flow of this ES, we used the data from the SilvaProtectCH project (Losey & Wehrli, 2013), which modeled the forests that are considered protective to human infrastructure from the aforementioned hazards.
