# Habitat quality - Threat layers

Here are the codes designed to produce the "threat layers" needed for the natcap InVEST habitat quality model. The layers used are:

1. primary_roads
2. secondary_roads
3. urban
4. rural_residential
5. crops

Layers roads are all produced together, the same goes for urban and rural_residential.

The codes are written in python 2.7 using the arcpy module
