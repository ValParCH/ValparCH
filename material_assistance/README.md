## Material and assistance - Wood supply/production

### Supply

The supply of this NCP is estimated through the average carbon gain in living biomass, values taken from FOEN GHG report(table 6-15, p.366, 2021).

Switzerland is divided in altitude and production regions (see carbon_storage NCP), and the corresponding value of gain in biomass is attributed to each cell of the LULC map that corresponds to "productive forest". 

the file C_gain_XXXX.csv comports the values averaged over the desired time period, and divided to get a value per pixel (as opposed to per hectare; *625/10 000).

the folder "rasters" is copied from the carbon_storage NCP.
